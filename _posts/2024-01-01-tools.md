### Browser
Firefox, it has powerful plugins, best developer tools.

### System
Windows is the most used, but for work I use Ubuntu in WSL 2.

Also I use Kali because of some programs their.

### IDE
- C#: Visual Studio 2022
- PHP, JS, Python, HTML, CSS: Visual Studio Code, notepad++, nodepad.exe
- C++: Visual Studio 2022, Codeblocks

### Videos
I like to get everything done in OBS, no need for further editing except cuts.

I use Clipchamp, because I don't need advanced editing, if I needed that I'd use Premeir or After Effects

### Communication
- Telegram Desktop - Greatest app, a lot of features, unlimited, easy automation.
- Discord - A lot of communities, **I use it in lightmode.**
- Whatsapp Desktop - Standard things, most used app in Saudi Arabia.

### Documents
Usually Google (Docs/Sheets/Slides), easy sharing, team work.

### Other
- Docker
- Git + GitHub Desktop
- Postman
