## The problem
A scientist has isolated five different peptides (1 to 5) containing five amino acids (named A, B, C, D, E). He determined the mass and the sequence of each peptide. The data which he obtained is shown on the table below

| Peptide | Amino Acids Sequence | Mass (Da) |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1       | BCDACCDEDCB        | 966       |
| 2       | ABBCAEEDECB        | 1099      |
| 3       | BACDAEAECA         | 1357      |
| 4       | CACADBACAEB        | 1279      |
| 5       | EDDCABBCCEE        | 1014      |

The mass of individual amino acids are shown in the table below

| Amino acids    | Mass (Da) | Amino acids    | Mass (Da) |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Alanine        | 89        | Leucine        | 131       |
| Arginine       | 174       | Lysine         | 146       |
| Asparagine     | 132       | Methionine     | 149       |
| Aspartic Acid  | 133       | Phenylalanine  | 165       |
| Cysteine       | 121       | Proline        | 115       |
| Glutamic Acid  | 147       | Serine         | 105       |
| Glutamine      | 146       | Threonine      | 119       |
| Glycine        | 75        | Tryptophan     | 204       |
| Histidine      | 155       | Tyrosine       | 181       |
| Isoleucine     | 131       | Valine         | 117       |

Note: The mass of a water molecule is 18 Da.

Indicate if each of the following statements is True or False.

A. Amino acid named C is serine
B. Amino acid named A is tyrosine
C. Amino acid named E is cysteine
D. Amino acid named B is glycine
