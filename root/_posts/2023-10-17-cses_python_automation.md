**Version: 2**
I just created a [Python script](/scripts/cses.py) that can:
- Login
- Get all tasks from problemset
- Get statistics of the problem
- Logout

It can be customizable in a lot of ways, the future updates will make it easier & do much more with less code

## TODO
- File/Code Submission
