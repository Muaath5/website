## The problem
MacOS have a special compiler for C/C++ which is **clang**.

clang works good, but doesn't support everything as G++

## Understanding

### How does `#include` works

For the compiler, it finds the files to include in 2 ways:
- **Default search path**: You can view it by running `g++ -print-search-dirs`
- **The extra paths during compilation**: the files after `-I` option

## The workaround

Since clang doesn't have those folders, you need to download them.

Here are _G++ 13.2.0_ folders:
- [`bits.zip`](/scripts/bits.zip)
- [`ext.zip`](/scripts/ext.zip)

After you install those folders, you have to put them into the include search path (`g++ -print-search-dirs`).

Usually it's on this format, `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/14.0.3/include/`

Put those folders there, unzip them, then you can use them.

### No Administrator rights
In this case you have to use `-I` for those files every compile.

You can make it easier by using an alias for it.
