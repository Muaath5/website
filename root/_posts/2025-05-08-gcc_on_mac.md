## The problem
MacOS have a special compiler for C/C++ which is **clang**, you would like to use **G++**.

The problem is when you run:
```sh
g++ --version
```
You will see it's Clang.

## Fixing
You need to put a `g++` program in a path earlier than `/usr/bin`, you can check it by:
```sh
echo $PATH
```

Usually `/usr/local/bin` should be earlier than `/usr/bin`, so you can copy `g++-14` from homebrew to it like this:
```sh
brew install gcc
mkdir /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-14 /usr/local/bin/g++
```
